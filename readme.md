Safiya's Bakery is a website dedicated to Tashkent's local bakeries.Although Safiya already has its own official website, but I didnâ€™t copy any information or code from there. The website contains six pages with a unique design, including a home, menu, about us, branches, and contact us. Tables, inputs, cards, and animations were utilized in this project. We can see in the responsive section of the header that when we access our website on various devices, the design changes. Changes will begin at 700px in the tablet version and 350px in the mobile version. Each page has a header, main, and footer page. For the new taste area, the initial page used buttons and hover, whereas the menu page had information and a summary.CSS animation was employed on the branch page that showcases various bakeries in Tashkent. In addition, on the last contact us page, there is a register section where customers may purchase exquisite sweets online. The submission portion was completed with jaca script; for example, if you will not write any information, the website will notify you that it is incorrect. Pages and icons were sourced from pexels.com, icons.com, and strc. Header, main, footer, section, table, form, and label were all borrowed from semantic design.
